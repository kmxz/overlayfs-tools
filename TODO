Todo list
=========

Common
------

1. Overlay filesystem mounted check
Prevent fscking when overlay is online. Now, we cannot distinguish mounted
directories if overlayfs was mounted with relative path. Should modify
Linux kernel together to support.

2. Check symbolic link with absolute path in lower layer
Symbolic link in the underlying layers with absolute path which point to
the target out of overlay filesystem or in the lower layers may lead to
modifing the wrong target, this not handled by Linux kernel now.

3. Xattr support check
If basic file system not support xattr, a lot of check points should skip.

4. Signal detect
Register SIGINT and SIGTERM sigaction handler to abort fsck safely.

4. Log
Export the optionally fsck log and results to the system log subsystem.

Features
--------

1. Check origin xattr   --- doing
Check basic elements in the origin xattr, verify it's corrupt or not, and
decode the file handle to check the corresponding origin target... Should
ask user to remove the corrupt and stale origin xattr.

2. Check index dir when "index=on"
1) Verify the origin xattr in the index dir, it should match the upper
   root dir.
2) Check index files (not dir and whiteout) in the index dir, check
   file name and decode the file handle to check the origin target,
   and check the nlink... Should ask user to remove the corrupt, stale
   and orphan index file.

3. Check index dir when "nfs_export=on" (depend on "index=on")
1) Verify the 'upper' xattr in the index dir. Encode the upper root dir
   and compare with the file handle in the 'upper' xattr...
2) Check index-dirs in the index dir, check dirname and decode the
   corresponding upper target to verify the file handle... Should remove
   (or whiteout) the corrput, stale and orphan index-dirs.
3) Check index whiteouts in the index dir...
